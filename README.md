# Statement of Purpose

The goal of this application is going to be making a realtime chat application that is styled like a terminal window. I would like to build this application using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript for the front end and Node.js, ExpressJS, and Socket.io for the back end. The main purpose of this application is to learn Socket.io, but also build an interesting and unique looking application.
