# Chat App

This will be my first real time chat application. This will be a MESN (Mongo, Express, Svelte, and Node) stack.

## Mongo

Mongo, or more accurately Mongoose, will serve as the database for the application.

## Express

Express will serve as the server for the application and will make use of Sockets to allow for RTM (Real Time Messages).

## Svelte

Svelte will be the client side of the application which will handle the basic structure and styles for the web/mobile app.

## Node

Node will be the development environment as well as the backbone language with which this application is developed.

# Design Goals

This RTA will be mobile first as I would eventually like to deploy it to both the Appstore and the Playstore.
